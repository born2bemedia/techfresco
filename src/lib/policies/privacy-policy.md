- Anonymization: Sometimes, we may anonymize data rather than delete it. Anonymized data cannot be used to identify individuals and may be used for analytical purposes, such as improving our services.

### **Data Review**

- Periodic Review: We regularly review the data we hold to ensure it remains relevant and necessary. Data no longer needed for its intended purpose or has exceeded its retention period is securely deleted or anonymized.
- Data Minimization: We adhere to the principle of data minimization by retaining only the information necessary to achieve specific objectives and discarding any data that is no longer required.

### **Secure Disposal**

## **Data Protection Practices**

At Tech Fresco, safeguarding your data is a top priority. We employ a comprehensive set of measures and practices to protect your information against unauthorised access, breaches, and misuse. Here’s an overview of the robust data protection strategies we utilise:

### **Security Protocols**

- Encryption: We use advanced encryption techniques to protect data in transit and at rest. This ensures that your data is secure during transmission over the internet and when stored in our systems.
- Firewalls and Intrusion Detection: Our network is fortified with state-of-the-art firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and prevent unauthorised access. These measures help protect against cyber threats and unauthorised attempts to access your data.

### **Access Controls**

- Role-Based Access: We implement role-based access controls to limit data access to authorised personnel only. Employees and partners have access only to the data necessary for their specific roles, minimising the risk of unauthorised exposure.
- Authentication: Strong authentication methods, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), are used to verify the identities of individuals accessing our systems. This adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorised access.

### **Data Handling Procedures**

- Data Minimization: We practise data minimization by collecting only the information necessary for specific purposes and limiting access to that data. This reduces the risk of excessive or unnecessary data exposure.
- Secure Storage: Our data storage solutions adhere to high-security standards, including physical security measures at our data centres and secure storage protocols for digital data.

### **Regular Security Audits**

- Vulnerability Assessments: We conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential weaknesses in our systems. These assessments help us avoid emerging threats and ensure effective protection measures.
- Compliance Checks: We regularly review our data protection practices to ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations and industry standards. This includes verifying that our security measures align with best practices and legal requirements.

### **Incident Response**

- Incident Management: In the event of a data breach or security incident, we have established incident response protocols to address and mitigate the impact quickly. This includes notifying affected parties and taking corrective actions to prevent future occurrences.
- Continuous Improvement: We continuously review and enhance our data protection measures based on lessons learned from incidents and evolving security threats. This proactive approach helps us maintain a high level of data security.

### **Employee Training**

- Awareness Programs: We provide regular training and awareness programs for our employees on data protection and cybersecurity best practices. This ensures all staff members are informed about their responsibilities and the importance of safeguarding customer data.

### **Third-Party Security**

- Vendor Management: We carefully select and monitor third-party service providers who handle data on our behalf. All vendors must adhere to our data protection standards and sign confidentiality agreements to protect data appropriately.

### **Secure Data Transmission**

- Secure Communication Channels: We utilise secure communication channels, such as HTTPS, to encrypt data transmitted over the internet. This ensures that sensitive information remains protected during online interactions.
