title: "Refund Policy"

Tech Fresco is committed to delivering high-quality IT services tailored to your business needs. Given our services and thorough approach, we have established a clear refund policy to ensure transparency and fairness.

## **Our Approach**

To ensure that we meet your exact needs and prevent any misunderstandings, we follow a detailed process:

1.  Initial Request and Analysis: When you contact us with a service request, we gather and review the companyâ€™s data to understand your IT gaps, needs, and requirements.
2.  Proposal Creation: We conduct a comprehensive evaluation and prepare a customised service offer based on the initial analysis. This offer includes a detailed description of the services, timelines, and costs.
3.  Discussion and Agreement: We then discuss the offer to ensure it meets your expectations. Any adjustments or clarifications are made during this phase.
4.  Agreement and Invoicing: We formalise the agreement with a signed contract once you approve the offer. Only after the agreement is finalised do we issue an invoice. Payment is then processed for the agreed-upon services.

This structured approach minimises the risk of errors and ensures that all parties know the services.

## **Dissatisfaction and Refund Requests**

In the rare event that you are dissatisfied with our services, we require the following to process any refund request:

1.  Evidence of Dissatisfaction: You must provide specific evidence detailing the issues you encountered with the service quality or other reasons for dissatisfaction.
2.  Documentation: Include any relevant documentation or proofs that support your claim of poor service or other concerns.

## **Resolution Process**

Once we receive your refund request along with the required evidence, we will:

1.  Review the Complaint: Our team will carefully review your submission and assess the issues raised.
2.  Negotiate and Revise: We are committed to addressing your concerns and will work to revise the service provision as needed to better align with your expectations.
3.  Resolution: We will strive to reach a satisfactory resolution. This may involve re-performing the service, offering a partial refund, or other measures as deemed appropriate.
